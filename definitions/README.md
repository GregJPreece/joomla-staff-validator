# Joomla Typescript Definitions

These typings are a work-in-progress, developed as part of our work building
Joomla components. Once they are at a certain level of reliability, I intend to
spin them off into a re-usable @types package or similar, for other developers
to utilise. Pull requests to improve them are welcome.
