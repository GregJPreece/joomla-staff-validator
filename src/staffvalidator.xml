        A helper component to allow site members to validate their identities when contacting
        people outside of the site organisation. If a site member is contacting someone via
        a method that is insecure or not easily verified, such as phone call or most e-mail, 
        this component can allow the person being contacted to validate the member as belonging
        to the website. A code is generated in advance by the site member and provided to the
        contact, who can then enter it into a public form on the website to verify its
        authenticity and the identity of the user who generated it.
